Sept

Oct

Nov

Dec

Notice a pattern?

These prefixes mean 7, 8, 9, and 10 and are used for our ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months. Why? Who knows.

I've see claims that October used to be the 8th month, but that doesn't actually explain anything. Why was it changed to something so nonsensical?

Why have 12 months anyway? Is it so we can have quarters because I do appreciate that

But none of this compares to February. Like... Why? We've got a bunch of extra days so we make some months 31, then take days away from February?

No, it doesn't make any sense.
