Undead like me.

* * *

I've been into zombies since college, when I watched the 1968 George Romero classic _The Night of the Living Dead_. We followed it up with the sequels, then a few years went by and I saw _28 Days Later_. But the truth is when someone says "zombie" I still immediately picture that iconic scene in _The Night of the Living Dead_ when the zombies are coming for the female lead and she just… walks past them, crying her eyes out.

## **Z is for Zombies**

So that’s my view of a zombie. Not fast. Hell - not even in color! Just a bunch of extras stumbling along in slow motion looking for brains.

Persistently.

And _that’s_ what makes zombies a force to be reckoned with. Not their powers. Physically they’re weird because they seem to have superhuman strength, but you can also pull off an arm with your bare hands, or knock their heads completely off their shoulders with a baseball bat. 

It’s not their abilities, it’s their tenacity.

It doesn’t matter where you go because they’re just going to keep coming, and making more zombies along the way. Perseverance and sheer numbers are how zombies get you.

### **Tenacious Me**

I’m going to assume that this post seems really weird right now, but it’s 30 days in and I’m reflecting a little bit. I guess I technically knew I _could_ write 31 posts in 31 days, but I’ve never had the kind of follow-through to actually do it before. Even doing NaNoWriMo in the past I’ve always frontloaded my work so that I could slack off when I lost steam, as predicted.

Furthermore, with the lack of sleep I’ve faced between the kids, the blog, and the cold from hell (finally on its last legs,) I _feel_ quite a bit like a zombie so there’s that too.

Perseverance and sheer numbers (of posts.) That’s how I get you.

## **The Cranberries**

Since I did include the song _Zombie_ on my Halloween playlist, I decided to mention it here too. 

For those not in the know, _Zombie_ by the Cranberries is about the 90s bombings in Northern Ireland by members of the IRA. If you listen to the lyrics, it's pretty apparent. 

Zombie charted in 1994 when it was released, and then again this year (2019) when lead singer Dolores O'Riordan died. 

My gal Friday really loves singing it - it’s hard not to - but it also gets me every time, despite how catchy it is.

## **Gross stuff**

And that’s it. Tomorrow we have actual Halloween and it’s time for costumes. And then we’re into November and a whole different adventure. For those of you who have stuck it out for the past 30 days: You’re awesome! And for those of you who are reading this from the future: You’re awesome too! I hope I’ve lured you here with some really cool stuff.

So really just thanks to you all, and I’ll see you tomorrow with some cute pictures! Hopefully.
